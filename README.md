# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Lyheng**, a web development learner who enjoys building clean and simple interfaces.
I specialize in React.js and love bringing ideas to life through smooth, responsive web applications. I'm committed to growing deeper in the frontend world and plan to explore more frameworks to sharpen my craft even further.
  
## 🧑‍🍳 What I'm Working On

* Leveling up my React.js skills
* Expanding my frontend knowledge
* Building more real-world projects to improve

## 📽️ Favorite Project
My favorite project so far is the [SHOP](https://shop-livid-rho.vercel.app/) a build that challenged me and helped me grow a lot with React.js and real world project as front-end.

Always learning, always building.✨
